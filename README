kio_pak: A KDE3 kioslave to explore and modify SingStar .pak files

Why:
	First of all, I've written this tool because I wanted to know about kioslaves, and though this would be the better way. Also, I wanted to have a tool to explore and modify .pak files easily, withouth having to "write my own".

When:
	For now, reading is the only feature supported, but it works flawesly!

What:
	Code is written in C++, using LOT of code from tar kioslave from kde-base package. Also, take in account that I've reverse engineered .pak files myself, and maybe I've got something wrong. If that's the case, please warn me!

Whom:
	If you'd like to help, please be my guest! Just in case, please send me an email to <uiomae@gmail.com>. And thanks!
